Solutions for <a href="http://www.codewars.com">codewars</a> problems I am not <i>too</i> ashamed to put on github.

<b><i>Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice</i></b>

## Overview
Here is a collection of solutions for Codewars challenges grouped by a kyÅ« rank. Each solved kata is placed in a separate folder named by its slug and contains a task description, a solution source code, and verification tests. All solutions were solved on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">the official website</a> and are verified against some random tests along with their original tests. Pay attention: most solutions are written using Java 11 and Python 3 language (some features which could be incompatible with Java 8 kata versions)

New solutions keep adding every day. Hit the watch button to stay tuned!

For quick access use the index table or do a search by kata URL, name, ID or slug in the repository.
